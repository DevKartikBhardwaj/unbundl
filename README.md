#intro
Chocogalaxy is a chocolate-selling website that has a homepage that showcases all the chocolates Chocogalaxy have using a carousel and the users have a unique feature of creating a bundle of chocolate with not more than 8 chocolates.
#Carousel(Task1)
To make carouse I use CSS transalate property with a little bit of dom manipulation.
#Bundle(task2)
I use localstorage to store the product added by the user. To calculate the total MRP and to manipulate the quantity of items I used custom JS logic.
#db.json
All the product data is stored in the form of JSON in the file db.json. The images are hosted on Cloudinary.
